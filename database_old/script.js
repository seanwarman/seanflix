      Not the first passage that I noticed of this 'fetch the 
      water' theme. Altough probably more notable in todays 
      standards because of the incestious overtones. It's 
      impossible to avoid the archaic charactaristics of the 
      Bible, why would you even try? I've always felt that 
      the more contraversial elements in these stories where 
      a major part of their appeal.`,
      passage: `
      And he looked, and behold a well in the field, and, lo,
      there were three flocks of sheep lying by it; for out of
      that well they watered the flocks: and a great stone was
      upon the well's mouth, and watered the sheep, and put the
      stone again upon the well's mouth in his place. And Jacob
      said unto them, My brethren, whence be ye? And they said,
      Of Haran are we. And he said unto them, Is he well? And 
      they said, He is well: and, behold, Rachel his daughter 
      cometh with the sheep. And he said, Lo, it is yet high day,
      neither is it time that the cattle should be gathered 
      together: water ye the sheep, and go and feed them. And
      they said, We cannot until all the flocks be gathered 
      together, and till they roll the stone from the well's 
      mouth; then we water the sheep.
       And while he yet spake with them, Rachel came with her
      father's sheep: for she kept them. And it came to pass,
      when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother's
      brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother's brother, 
      that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well's
      mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mother' brother.
      And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept.
      And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father's brother, and
      that he was Rebekah's son: and she ran and told her father.
       And it came to pass, when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob
      his sister's son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced 
      him, and kissed him and brought him to his house.

      passage: `
      And the whole earth was on one language, and of one speech. 
      And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that 
      they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and thy dwelt 
      there. And they had brick for stone, and slime they had for
      mortar. And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a
      tower, whose top msy reach unto heaven; and let us make us a
      name, lest we be scattered abroad across the face of the 
      whole earth. And the Lord came down to see the city and the 
      tower, which the chilren of men builded. And the Lord said, 
      Behold, the people is one, and they have all one language;
      and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained
      from them, which they have imagined to do. Go to, let us go 
      down, and there confound their language, that they may not
      understand one another's speech. So the Lord scattered them
      abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth: and they
      left off to build the city. Therefore is the name of it 
      called Babel; because the Lord did there confound the 
      language of all the earth: and from thence did the Lord
      scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth.

      The second time this happens between David and Saul, this time 
      Saul see\'s his mistake and decides to stop chasing David. 
      This is so similar to the previous story that you get the sense 
      that some stories in the Bible have been told in different 
      variations in the past and so rather than choose one the author 
      has written both versions into the story, which allows them to 
      keep their charactor and perhaps any subtle importance that 
      each version has.

      passage: `
      So David and Abishai came to the people by night: and, behold,
      Saul lay sleeping within the tranch, and his spear stuck in the
      ground at his bolster: but Abner and the people lay round about
      him. The said Abishai to David, God hath delivered thine enemy
      into thine hand today: now therefore let me smite him, I pray 
      thee, with the spear even to the earth at once, and I will not
      smite him the second time. And David said to Abishai, Destroy 
      him not: for who can stretch forth his hand against the Lord's
      anointed, and be guiltless? David said furthermore, As the Lord
      liveth, the Lord shall smite him; or his day shall come to die;
      or he shall descend into battle, and perish. The Lord forbid
      that I should stretch forth mine hand against the Lord's 
      anointed: but, I pray thee, take thou now the spear that is in
      his bolster, and the cruse of water, and let us go. So David 
      took the spear and cruse of water from Saul's bolster; and they
      gat them away, and no man saw it, nor knew it, neither awaked:
      for they where all asleep; because a deep sleep from the Lord 
      was fallen upon them.

      For me, this was the most powerful moment between David and Saul. The 
      imagary and situation lend well to the drama and also this moment comes after 
      David and Saul have been seperated for some time; David is essentially 
      banished and hiding for his life in the mountains while Saul the king of 
      Israel is out for blood from pure jealousy of David and his own failure to 
      amount to his potential in God's eyes.

      passage: `
      Then Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and went to seek
      David and his men upon the rocks of the wild goats. And he came to the 
      sheepcotes by the way, where was a cave; and Saul went in to cover his feet:
      and David and his men remained in the sides of the cave. And the men of David
      said unto him, Behold the day of which the Lord said unto thee, Behold, I will
      deliver thine enemy into thine hand, that thou mayest do to him as it shall
      seem good unto thee. Then David arose, and cut off the skirt of Saul's robe
      privily. And it came to pas afterward, that David's heart smote him, because
      he had cut off Saul's skirt. And he said unto his men, the Lord forbit that I
      should do this thing unto my master, the Lord's anointed to stretch forth mine 
      hand against him, seeing he is the anointed of the Lord. So David stayed his
      servents with these words, and suffered them not to rise against Saul. But Saul
      rose up out of the cave, and went on his way.
      David also arose afterward, and went out of the cave, and cried after Saul, 
      saying, My Lord the king. And when Saul looked behind him, David stooped with
      his face to the earth, and bowed himself. And David said to Saul, wherefore 
      hearest thou men's words, saying, Behold, David seeketh thy hurt? Behold, this
      day thine eyes have seen how that the Lord had delivered thee today into mine
      hand in the cave: and some bade me kill thee: but mine eye spared thee; and
      I said, I will not put forth mine hand against my lord; fore he is the Lord's
      anointed. Moreover, my father, see, ye, see the skirt of thy robe in my hand:
      for in that I cut off the skirt of thy robe, and killed thee not, know thou and
      see that there is neither evil nor transgretion in mine hand, and I have not
      sinned against thee; yet thou huntest my soul to take it. The Lord judge 
      between me and thee, and the Lord avenge me of thee; but mine hand shall not be
      upon thee. As saith the proverb of the ancients, Wickedness preceedeth from the
      wicked; but mine hand shall not be upon thee. After whom is the kind of Israel
      come out? After whom dost thou persue? After a dead dog, after a flea. The Lord
      therefore be judge, and judge between me and thee, and see, and plead my cause,
      and deliver me out of thine hand.
       And it came to pass, when David had made an end of speaking these words unto 
      Saul, that Saul said, Is this thy voice, my son David? And Saul lifted up his
      voice and wept. And he said to David, Thou art more righteous than I: for thou
      hast rewarded me good, whereas I have reward thee evil.

      passage: `
      The trees went forth on a time to anoint a king over them; 
      and they said unto the olive tree, Reign thou over us. But
      the olive trees said unto them, Should I leave my fatness,
      wherewith by me they honour God and man, and go to be
      promoted over the trees? And the trees said to the fig 
      tree, Come thou, and reign over us. But the fig tree said
      unto them, Should I forsake my sweetness, and my good 
      fruit, and go to be promoted over the trees? Then said the
      trees unto the vine, Come thou, and reign over us. And the
      vine said unto them, Should I leave my wine, which cheereth
      God and man, and go to be promoted over the trees? Then
      said all of the trees unto the bramble, Come thou, and
      reign over us, And the bramble said unto the trees, If in
      truth you anoint me king over you, then come and put your
      trust in my shadow: and if not, let fire come out of the 
      bramble, and devour the cedars of Lebanon.
